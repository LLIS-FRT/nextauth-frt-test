Minor quirks:
  - We need to make a page for admins to validate availabilities
  - We need to make a page for admins to create shift (with less than the minimum amount of users)
  - Add functionality for users to request to be added to a shift that isn't full yet
  - After logging in it doesnt always show the data and the user has to refresh the page



BIG CHANGES
  - Finish converting the protected routes to use the permission system
  - Finish the Permissions list and optimize the naming conventions
